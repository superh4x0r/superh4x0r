ðŸ‘‹ hi, iâ€™m @superh4x0r!

i'm a student (but only for one more month!) helping add to the softdev textbook for my school. we got a grant to create an electronic version of the textbook that students can use for free! i'm all about open source and free knowledge and teaching, so i'm incredibly grateful and excited about this opportunity.

i'll add links here as i add more content! in the meantime, shameless self-plug to my [main profile](https://github.com/shitchell)! :P
